# Quantum-Simulation
In Quantum Computers we try to create simulation by creating a quantum circuit for our problem and the circuit will perform computational part.
Variational Qunatum Eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum algorithm to estimate ground state energy of a system. Here we use anastz that will have a initial guess of wave function abd by using optimizer we try to find minimize energy eigen value corresponds to eigen wave function. here the hamiltonian is encoded as hermitian matrix using Jordan-Wigner transformation or Gray code encoding.
